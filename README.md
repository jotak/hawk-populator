# hawk-populator
Simple nodejs script to quickly populate some fake values to a running Hawkular-metrics server.

# Usage
Just clone this repo and run `node populator.js` (assuming you already have nodejs installed)

You can edit the JS and/or TS files to change some settings such as starting and ending dates, metric names, tags, etc.

To build typescript, just run `tsc` without argument.
